        <div class="column"><p>So I (74M) was recently hit by a car (2014 Honda)
             and died. My wife (5F) organized me a funeral (cost $2747) without
             asking me (74M) at all. I (74M) was unable to make it because I (74M) was dead(17 days). 
             At the funeral I heard my dad (15M) and other family members 
             talking about how they wish I could be there and now I feel bad for not showing up. AITA?</p></div>
        <div class="column"><p>Fresh prince of Bel-air has ruined my life. I memorised the entire of the 
            theme tune and started randomly using it in everyday conversation out
             of habit. Relationships have started to fall apart, and people have 
             tarted to avoid me. I don't even try to use it any more. 
             It just comes out, subconsiously. Will Smith has ruined my life.</p></div>

            <p id="dragonforce">Humans can only stand so much awesome, it's in our genetic 
            code. Dragonforce, for example, taps into the unused portion 
            of our brains and unravels a sixth sense to a new level 
            of awesome that humans cannot normally experiance. When 
            you listen to Dragonforce, you are not only listening to 
            music, you are taking a journey to another place, another 
            world that some can never hope to behold on their own. 
            Like a scout sent into an unknown land, a voyager on a 
            quest for the unknown, like a tribal Shaman on a spiritual 
            journey...all society can hope for is that you bring back 
            a piece of what you now have engraved upon your soul, 
             and help free the repressed souls and minds of all civilization.</p>
